    'Carbon dioxide is a chemical compound with the chemical formula CO2. It is found in the gas state at room temperature. CO2 is measured in parts per million (ppm). CO2 is an important greenhouse gas that helps to trap heat in our atmosphere. Without it, our planet would be inhospitably cold. Human beings do exhale almost three billion tons of carbon dioxide annually, but the carbon we exhale is the same carbon that was “inhaled” from the atmosphere by the plants we consume.';

    'American academics found that health problems can be caused by exposure to CO2 levels as low as 1,000 ppm. CO2 can cause health problems such as inflammation, reduced cognitive performance and kidney and bone problems.';

const thirdParagraph =
    'To minimize the risk of airborne transmission of viruses, CO2 levels should be as low as possible in all indoor spaces. It is recommended to stay close to 400 ppm, (outdoor CO2 concentration), and below 800 ppm. If the threshold is exceeded, it is recommended to leave the room and to renew the air. ';
