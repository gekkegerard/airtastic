As the temperature or heat burden increases, people may feel: increased irritability, loss of concentration and ability to do mental tasks, loss of concentration and ability to do mental tasks and Loss of ability to do skilled tasks or heavy work. In moderately hot environments, the body 'goes to work' to get rid of excess heat so it can maintain its normal body temperature. The heart rate increases to pump more blood through outer body parts and skin so that excess heat is lost to the environment, and sweating occurs. These changes place additional demands on the body. Changes in blood flow and excessive sweating reduce a person's ability to do physical and mental work. Manual work creates additional metabolic heat and adds to the body heat burden.";
