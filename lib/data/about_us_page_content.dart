    "For our 'App Development' course, we had to develop an app (who would have guessed that?). Markus already had a project in mind he wanted to create: a temperature/humidity meter for your room that stores data in a database with an app to display everything. However, for app development, we needed to have a client, so we checked if any teacher would be willing to fulfill this role. \n\nWe approached Mr. Bijlsma, he was enthusiastic about our project and had a good idea for an addition to the project: an ozone meter. He was curious about how unhealthy it is to have a printer in the office room of the teachers.\n\nMany people don't know that printers emit ozone when printing, and this could be potentially harmful to your health. So, he wanted a way to make the ozone emission of the printers insightful. We combined both ideas into this one project.\n\nBut enough about the app iself, who are the individuals behind the app?";

    "Hello, I'm Gerard Brouwer, I am a fourth-year electrical engineering student at NHL Stenden. I originally come from Haule, a small village in southeast Friesland. But I now live with my girlfriend, Lotte, in Meppel. I've been playing korfball for almost my entire life and am an active volunteer. I'm part of the New Year's Eve team in Haule: the H.O.P. (Haule Oudejaars Ploeg), I'm on the board of the korfball association, and I'm involved in a new housing construction project in Haule.\n\nIn my remaining free time, I enjoy pursuing hobbies. I've been working on converting a Puch (a moped) to electric for about 2 years, and I also find home automation, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and similar projects very interesting. In short, a busy and enjoyable life.";

    "Hi, my name is Markus Glumm. Just like Gerard I'm a fourth-year electrical engineering student at NHL Stenden. I was born in Germany, near the city of Leipzig. Back when I was 8 years old, I moved to the Netherlands together with my parents, since then, I live in Drachten, Friesland. My hobbies are running, motorcycling, programming, playing keyboard, 3D-designing, and 3D-printing. ";
