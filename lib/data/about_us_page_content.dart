    "For the app development course, we had to develop an app (who would have guessed that?). Markus already had a project he wanted to work on: a temperature/humidity meter for your room that stores data in a database with an app to display everything. However, for app development, we needed to have a client, so we checked if any teacher would be willing to be our client. We approached Mr. Bijlsma. He was enthusiastic about our project and had a nice addition: an ozone meter. He already had this project and was curious about how unhealthy it is to have a printer in your office. Because what many people don't know is that printers emit ozone when they print, and this can be harmful to your health. So the project began.";

    "Hello, I'm Gerard Brouwer, as mentioned earlier, I am a fourth-year electrical engineering student at NHL Stenden. I originally come from Haule, a small village in southeast Friesland. But I now live with my girlfriend, Lotte, in Meppel. I've been playing korfball for almost my entire life and am an active volunteer. I'm part of the New Year's Eve team in Haule: the H.O.P. (Haule Oudejaars Ploeg), I'm on the board of the korfball association, and I'm involved in a new housing construction project in Haule. In my remaining free time, I enjoy pursuing hobbies. I've been working on converting a Puch (a moped) to electric for about 2 years, and I also find home automation, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and similar projects very interesting. In short, a busy and enjoyable life.";
