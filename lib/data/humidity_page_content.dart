    'Humidity is the concentration of water vapor present in the air. Water vapor, the gaseous state of water, is generally invisible to the human eye. Humidity indicates the likelihood for precipitation, dew, or fog to be present. Humidity depends on the temperature and pressure of the system of interest. The same amount of water vapor results in higher relative humidity in cool air than warm air. Humidity is measured in percentage.';

const secondParagraph =
    'High humidity can have an adverse effect on the human body. Because the air feels warmer than the official, recorded temperature, it can contribute to feelings of low energy and lethargy. In addition, hyperthermia,  or over-heating as a result of your bodyâ€™s inability to effectively let out heat, can negatively impact your health in conditions of high humidity. Some health risks which result from overexposure to humidity (hyperthermia) include: dehydration, fatigue, muscle cramps, heat exhaustion, fainting, heat stroke.';

const thirdParagraph =
    'According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the best indoor relative humidity falls between 30% and 50%, and it should never exceed 60%. Other studies suggest 40% to 60% is a better range. Regardless, 60% seems to be the agreed-upon threshold for indoor humidity.';
